            Sukhoi was founded in the Soviet Union by Pavel Sukhoi in 1939 and was created as the Sukhoi Design Bureau (OKB-51). After being briefly closed by Joseph Stalin in 1949, the bureau was reopened in 1953 and went on to develop many successful aircraft. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Sukhoi merged with other Russian aviation companies in 2006 to form the United Aircraft Corporation.
